# calculator-ToP
This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Calculator"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

First we need the main 4 mathematical functions in JS:

Add~
This function will take two inputs and add them together as the return
Subtract~
This function will take two inputs and substract one from the other and return it
Multiply~
This function will take two inputs and multiply them together as part of the return
Divide~
This function will take two inputs and divide them together as part of the return

Then the HTML is cretaed along with the CSS for the GUI

Now, it's time connect the buttons with the JS to update the calculator screen and make the math operations and display the result
